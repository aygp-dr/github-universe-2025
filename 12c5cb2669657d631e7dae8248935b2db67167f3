Comprehensive GitHub Universe 2025 Research Lab Implementation

Context:
- Created during GitHub Universe 2025 preparation
- Implements scientific research methodology for conference content
- Uses org-mode for literate programming and documentation
- Integrates multiple analysis tools and visualization frameworks

Key Components:
1. Session Management System - Track and organize conference sessions
2. Experiment Framework - Reproducible research experiments with logging
3. Literature Management - Academic paper organization with bibtex
4. Research Synthesis - Concept mapping and knowledge graph generation
5. Analysis Tools - Statistical analysis and data visualization
6. Org-mode Integration - Executable documentation with Babel

Technical Stack:
- Python: Core analysis and computation
- Org-mode: Documentation and literate programming
- Mermaid: System diagrams and concept mapping
- Git: Version control with hooks and automation
- Jupyter: Interactive analysis notebooks

Future Experiments:
- AI agent capability analysis for routine task automation
- Conference session effectiveness metrics
- Knowledge synthesis from multiple research sources
- Automated literature review and synthesis
- Real-time session tracking and note-taking

This framework supports systematic research approaches for conference content,
enabling reproducible experiments and comprehensive analysis workflows.
